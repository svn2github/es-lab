Main features of this tool:

1) Complete CFA2 for all native objects
2) Precious/Non precious sensitivity for all functions which have clones.
3) Trusted code is not subject to freeze constraints. As a result an attacker can write to native objects by calling trusted functions.
4) DOM and window are separate objects. "window" points to a global object which has a "document" property pointing to DOM.
Top level 'this' also points to window object.

Adsafe comments:
1) Comment out 'adsafe_lib[name] = f(adsafe_lib);' from ADSAFE.lib function
2) Run 'node v8analyzerAdsafe.js adsafeAnn.js out -cloneNative'
3) Comment out the function 'mozilla' and all calls to it. The problem is that mozilla assigns a new function to Array.prototype but then the new function does not have clones.
